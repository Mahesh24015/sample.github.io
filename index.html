    <h1>Vector Concepts in Linear Algebra</h1>

    <p>Let's break down the concepts of <strong>subspace</strong>, <strong>basis</strong>, <strong>dimension</strong>, and <strong>span</strong> using the vector:</p>
    <p><strong>v</strong> = <sup>T</sup><sub>(3, 4)</sub> in the context of <strong>R<sup>2</sup></strong>.</p>

    <h2>1. Subspace</h2>
    <p>A <strong>subspace</strong> refers to a set of vectors that is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication and includes the zero vector. For a single vector in <strong>R<sup>2</sup></strong>, the subspace it generates is a line through the origin in the direction of that vector.</p>

    <p><strong>Subspace Generated by v:</strong> The subspace generated by the vector <strong>v</strong> = <sup>T</sup><sub>(3, 4)</sub> is all scalar multiples of this vector. This is a line in <strong>R<sup>2</sup></strong> passing through the origin and the point (3, 4).</p>

    <p>Mathematically, this subspace can be expressed as:</p>
    <p><strong>span{ (3, 4) } = { c * (3, 4) | c ∈ R }</strong></p>

    <h2>2. Basis</h2>
    <p>A <strong>basis</strong> for a subspace is a set of vectors that spans the subspace and is linearly independent. For a single vector <strong>v</strong>, the basis for the subspace it generates is simply <strong>{ v }</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>Basis for the Subspace:</strong> The basis for the subspace generated by <strong>v</strong> = <sup>T</sup><sub>(3, 4)</sub> is:</p>
    <p><strong>{ (3, 4) }</strong></p>

    <h2>3. Dimension</h2>
    <p>The <strong>dimension</strong> of a subspace is the number of vectors in its basis. For a line through the origin in <strong>R<sup>2</sup></strong> (which is the subspace generated by a single non-zero vector), the dimension is 1.</p>

    <p><strong>Dimension:</strong> The dimension of the subspace generated by <strong>v</strong> is <strong>1</strong>, as it is spanned by a single vector.</p>

    <h2>4. Span</h2>
    <p>The <strong>span</strong> of a set of vectors is the set of all possible linear combinations of those vectors. For a single vector <strong>v</strong>, its span is the line in the vector space that includes all scalar multiples of that vector.</p>

    <p><strong>Span of v:</strong> The span of <strong>v</strong> = <sup>T</sup><sub>(3, 4)</sub> is:</p>
    <p><strong>span{ (3, 4) } = { c * (3, 4) | c ∈ R }</strong></p>

    <p>This is a line through the origin in the direction of the vector <sup>T</sup><sub>(3, 4)</sub>.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Subspace:</strong> The line through the origin in <strong>R<sup>2</sup></strong> along the direction of <sup>T</sup><sub>(3, 4)</sub>.</li>
        <li><strong>Basis:</strong> <strong>{ (3, 4) }</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Dimension:</strong> 1</li>
    </ul>
