# Vector Concepts in Linear Algebra

Let's break down the concepts of **subspace**, **basis**, **dimension**, and **span** using the vector

\[ \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \]

in the context of \( \mathbb{R}^2 \).

## 1. Subspace

A **subspace** refers to a set of vectors that is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication and includes the zero vector. For a single vector in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \), the subspace it generates is a line through the origin in the direction of that vector.

- **Subspace Generated by \(\mathbf{v}\)**: The subspace generated by the vector

\[ \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \]

is all scalar multiples of this vector. This is a line in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) passing through the origin and the point \( (3, 4) \).

Mathematically, this subspace can be expressed as:

\[ \text{span} \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \right\} = \left\{ c \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \mid c \in \mathbb{R} \right\} \]

## 2. Basis

A **basis** for a subspace is a set of vectors that spans the subspace and is linearly independent. For a single vector \( \mathbf{v} \), the basis for the subspace it generates is simply

\[ \left\{ \mathbf{v} \right\} \]

- **Basis for the Subspace**: The basis for the subspace generated by

\[ \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \]

is:

\[ \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \right\} \]

## 3. Dimension

The **dimension** of a subspace is the number of vectors in its basis. For a line through the origin in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) (which is the subspace generated by a single non-zero vector), the dimension is 1.

- **Dimension**: The dimension of the subspace generated by \( \mathbf{v} \) is 1, as it is spanned by a single vector.

## 4. Span

The **span** of a set of vectors is the set of all possible linear combinations of those vectors. For a single vector \( \mathbf{v} \), its span is the line in the vector space that includes all scalar multiples of that vector.

- **Span of \(\mathbf{v}\)**: The span of

\[ \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \]

is:

\[ \text{span} \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \right\} = \left\{ c \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \mid c \in \mathbb{R} \right\} \]

This is a line through the origin in the direction of the vector

\[ \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \].

## Summary

- **Subspace**: The line through the origin in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) along the direction of

\[ \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \].

- **Basis**:

\[ \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \right\} \]

- **Dimension**: 1
