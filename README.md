# Vector Concepts in Linear Algebra

## Example Vector

Consider the vector:

\[ \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \]

### Subspace

A **subspace** is a set of vectors that is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication and includes the zero vector. The subspace generated by the vector \(\mathbf{v}\) is the line through the origin in the direction of \(\mathbf{v}\).

- **Subspace Generated by \(\mathbf{v}\)**:
  \[
  \text{span} \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \right\} = \left\{ c \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \mid c \in \mathbb{R} \right\}
  \]

### Basis

A **basis** for a subspace is a set of vectors that spans the subspace and is linearly independent. For the subspace generated by a single vector, the basis is simply the set containing that vector.

- **Basis for the Subspace**:
  \[
  \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \right\}
  \]

### Dimension

The **dimension** of a subspace is the number of vectors in its basis. For a line in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) (the subspace generated by a single non-zero vector), the dimension is 1.

- **Dimension**: 1

### Span

The **span** of a set of vectors is the set of all possible linear combinations of those vectors. For a single vector, its span is the line through the origin that includes all scalar multiples of that vector.

- **Span of \(\mathbf{v}\)**:
  \[
  \text{span} \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \right\} = \left\{ c \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \mid c \in \mathbb{R} \right\}
  \]

This line represents all scalar multiples of \(\mathbf{v}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\).
