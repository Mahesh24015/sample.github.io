Let's break down the concepts of subspace, basis, dimension, and span using the vector 
𝑣
=
(
3
4
)
v=( 
3
4
​
 ) in the context of 
𝑅
2
R 
2
 .

1. Subspace
Subspace refers to a set of vectors that is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication and includes the zero vector. For a single vector in 
𝑅
2
R 
2
 , the subspace it generates is a line through the origin in the direction of that vector.

Subspace Generated by 
𝑣
v: The subspace generated by the vector 
𝑣
=
(
3
4
)
v=( 
3
4
​
 ) is all scalar multiples of this vector. This is a line in 
𝑅
2
R 
2
  passing through the origin and the point 
(
3
,
4
)
(3,4).

Mathematically, this subspace can be expressed as:

span
{
(
3
4
)
}
=
{
𝑐
(
3
4
)
∣
𝑐
∈
𝑅
}
span{( 
3
4
​
 )}={c( 
3
4
​
 )∣c∈R}
2. Basis
A basis for a subspace is a set of vectors that spans the subspace and is linearly independent. For a single vector 
𝑣
v, the basis for the subspace it generates is simply 
{
𝑣
}
{v}.

Basis for the Subspace: The basis for the subspace generated by 
𝑣
=
(
3
4
)
v=( 
3
4
​
 ) is:
{
(
3
4
)
}
{( 
3
4
​
 )}
3. Dimension
The dimension of a subspace is the number of vectors in its basis. For a line through the origin in 
𝑅
2
R 
2
  (which is the subspace generated by a single non-zero vector), the dimension is 1.

Dimension: The dimension of the subspace generated by 
𝑣
v is 
1
1, as it is spanned by a single vector.
4. Span
The span of a set of vectors is the set of all possible linear combinations of those vectors. For a single vector 
𝑣
v, its span is the line in the vector space that includes all scalar multiples of that vector.

Span of 
𝑣
v: The span of 
𝑣
=
(
3
4
)
v=( 
3
4
​
 ) is:

span
{
(
3
4
)
}
=
{
𝑐
(
3
4
)
∣
𝑐
∈
𝑅
}
span{( 
3
4
​
 )}={c( 
3
4
​
 )∣c∈R}
This is a line through the origin in the direction of the vector 
(
3
4
)
( 
3
4
​
 ).

𝑅

​
 ).
